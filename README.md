# MOSES - Model Of The Swedish Economic System

This repository holds C++ models of the **Model Of The Swedish Economic System**.

The aspiration of this project is to replicate the most recent APL MOSES model in object code, and to convert the MOSES household sector to micro. The nature of object-oriented programming should facilitate the micro conversion of the household sector significantly.

### Branches
This repository holds multiple C++ MOSES versions.

**MOSES-1976**  
Based on pseudocode in **_A MICRO-MACRO INTERACTIVE SIMULATION MODEL OF THE SWEDISH ECONOMY_ (Gunnar Eliasson, 1976)**.

**MOSES-1989** (in development)  
Based on pseudocode in **_MOSES Code_ (James W. Albrecht et al., 1989)**.
